    question:"Does knowing TypeScript make you a better front-end engineer/web developer?",
    answer:"Typescript is superset of JavaScript, i.e. you can write the same js code in ts file and it will work perfectly fine. Although some of the framework like angular is totally written in typescript and its advised to use the ts code for its various components. But I have never seen people asking if you know ts, instead seen lot of interest in js. Anyway it's not coding that really matters, it's the logic that you can apply. Most of the documentation provides you the codes easily and you can just copy paste.",

    question:"What is the most interesting fact that you know and I don't, but I should?",
    answer:"The ancient Egyptians used mouldy bread on infected wounds and cuts in order to treat some patients, and no one understood why. later the year 1928, five thousand years later, modern science arrived if it was discovered by the scientist Alexander Fleming that penicillin had a great effect as an antibiotic on bacteria. What is the relationship of bread to the subject? When bread is left rot, it secretes a fungus called Penicillium, from which penicillin is derived, the most famous antibiotic used so far to treat bacteria known to the Egyptians 5,000 years ago",

    question:"Did you ever get an order from someone who had absolutely no authority over you? What was it and what did you do?",
    answer:"Many times. The funniest in retrospect was when I was in the military. I was a commander straight out of university, so young, 22 years old. One of my guys, a private, was on another military installation near our post shopping at their exchange as it was much larger than ours. Leaving the parking lot, a woman made an illegal turn in front of him and he flipped her off (failing to see the two bright shiny stars under the officer’s sticker on the windshield). Fast forward a couple of days. I get an incident report from the MPs on the other post telling me all about the nefarious flipping-the-bird private. When you got these as a commander back then, you decided what action should be taken with said individual, fill out the action taken, sign and send it back to the MPs. So I look into the guys record, as short as it was, and see he has been an exemplary soldier except for the terrible action of flipping off a bad driver on a different post. One of the many things I could do was counsel him, which I felt was more than adequate for the infraction. Talk to the soldier, tell him not to do it again, and fill out the form and fax it back to the MPs. About an hour later I get a call from a very angry two-star general who is the base commander at the other post. He informed me that the bad driver who got flipped off was his wife. He felt I should have courtmartialled the soldier, and he told me he “commands” me to. Even at 22, I was a smart-ass. I let the general rant for awhile and then informed him, I do not report to him, he is not in my chain of command, and my superiors leave punishment up to the unit commander. I went on to tell him, perhaps if his wife were a better driver, she would not get flipped off by 18-year-old privates. I let him know my troop had never done anything else wrong, and counseling him was the only punishment he would receive and hung up the phone. Aboutoutout 10 minutes later, the four-star general I reported to came all the way across post and into my office. Closed the door behind him and burst out laughing. When he stopped, he asked if I had really told the base commander that his wife should be a better driver. I confirmed and he laughed even harder. He gave me huge kudos for standing up for my troop and always had my back.",
